## Introduction
The purpose of this prototype is to create an open source web app that serves as both a functional and communicational prototype for digitizing and automating the processes of submitting food donations, approving donations, storing donations in the fridge, and redistributing donations for the food recycling organization, Feed it Forward. The goal is to streamline their workflow, improve the overall efficiency of the organization, and effectively communicate the app's intended purpose and functionalities. The prototype consists of four main parts:
1. Donation
2. Scheduling pickups and deliveries
3. Monitoring the progress of food distribution
4. User management and customization

### Donation
In this section, users, who are exclusive members of Feed it Forward, can create new incoming donation orders with a form. They can fill in all necessary information required for the donation to be reviewed, such as the donor's details, the type of food, the food's condition and quality, and the designated pickup and must-consume-by dates. This centralized and intuitive system replaces the need for disparate processes like using a whiteboard and making phone calls.

### Scheduling Pickups and Deliveries
After a donation is accepted, it moves to the next stage where the user, typically the head of the organization or someone with the appropriate level of responsibility, schedules a pickup or delivery. The pickup is for collecting a donation from a donor, and delivery is for sending processed and packaged food from the Feed it Forward organization to recipients. The scheduling interface has been designed to accommodate both delivery and pickup tasks in one place, making it more convenient and efficient for users.

### Monitoring the Progress of Food Distribution
This part of the app allows the organization to actively monitor and track the progress of food deliveries and pickups. It features an interactive map with a calendar, mapping out all the events, including pickups and deliveries. The head of the organization can easily view who is responsible for each task and whether the food has been delivered or not. Additionally, when drivers log in to the app, they see a driver-specific interface that provides them with all the necessary information to complete their tasks without being overwhelmed by unrelated details.

### User Management and Customization
The app also includes user management features to add new users and manage access levels, as well as allowing for customization of the platform to better suit the organization's needs. The low-code, no-code technology used to build the app ensures that even users without coding knowledge can make small adjustments and fine-tune the system as needed. By serving as both a functional and communicational prototype, it provides an accurate representation of the app's purpose, value, and user experience while facilitating feedback, testing, and future development.

## Prototype Iterations
There are three major iterations of the prototype:

### Version 1 - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
This version demonstrates the basic functionalities of the app, such as submitting and approving donations, scheduling deliveries, and visualizing interactions. The main purpose is to showcase the app's basic capabilities without fully developing it.

*Key Design Decisions and Justifications:*
- Focus on core functionality: To establish the minimum requirements necessary for a functional prototype and gather initial user feedback
- Simple user interface (UI): To allow users to quickly familiarize themselves with the prototype and provide feedback on its essential features

### Version 2 - Usable Product
This version includes improvements based on feedback from stakeholders. It improves the UI, makes the app more user-friendly, and includes team management features.

*Key Design Decisions and Justifications:*
- Improved UI: To create a more visually appealing and intuitive user experience, resulting in higher user satisfaction
- Enhanced navigation: To make the app more user-friendly and reduce the learning curve for new users
- Team management features: To facilitate the assignment and tracking of tasks within the organization and improve collaboration

### Version 3 - Integrated System
This version includes warehouse viewing, a restructured database, and better integration with the growing product ecosystem. It serves as the foundation for future development.

*Key Design Decisions and Justifications:*
- Warehouse viewing: To provide an overview of food inventory and assist in efficient organization and space management
- Restructured database: To optimize data storage and retrieval, improving performance and scalability
- Integration with the product ecosystem: To ensure compatibility with existing systems and simplify the adoption process for users, allowing seamless interaction between different components

## Conceptual Design and Engineering Requirements
The app has helped identify gaps in the conceptual design, particularly regarding the ease of use and customization for senior members within the organization. This has led to a reevaluation of the conceptual design, taking into consideration the following aspects:

1. **Ease of use:** The app should be easy to navigate and intuitive for users of all ages and technical abilities, including senior members within the organization.
2. **Customization:** The app should allow administrators to easily customize the interface and functionality to meet the unique needs of their organization.
3. **Scalability:** The app should be able to handle a growing number of users and transactions without sacrificing performance or user experience.
4. **Integration:** The app should seamlessly integrate with existing systems used by the organization, such as databases and inventory management tools.
5. **Security:** The app should follow industry best practices to ensure the privacy and security of user data.

## Future Work
One possible future direction is to create a tutorial on how the app was built so other organizations around the world can build a similar app using Glide, allowing the code to serve multiple organizations involved in food recycling. The tutorial can cover topics such as:

1. **App development process:** A step-by-step guide on creating an app using Glide, from setting up an account to publishing the final product.
2. **Customization and adaptation:** Detailed instructions on how to tailor the app to fit the unique needs of different organizations, including modifying the user interface, adding new features, and integrating with existing systems.
3. **Best practices and tips:** Recommendations for optimizing the app's performance, improving the user experience, and ensuring data privacy and security.
4. **Case studies and success stories:** Examples of how other organizations have successfully adopted and customized the app to address their food recycling needs, highlighting the benefits and lessons learned.
5. **Community and support:** Information on how to join a community of app developers and users, where they can exchange ideas, ask questions, and receive technical support.
